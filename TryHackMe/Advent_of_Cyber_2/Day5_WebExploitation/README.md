- SQLMap
- SQLMap & Burpsuite

### 1. Without using directory brute forcing, what's Santa's secret login panel?
```
/santapanel
```
Using the hint we know it must be a combination of 2 words from the question.

### 2. Visit Santa's secret login panel and bypass the login using SQLi

1. Enter the url `http://10.10.X.X:8000/santapanel` to access the login panel
2. Use an SQLi attack on the username to login. The payload is going to be `' or true; --`

### 3. How many entries are there in the gift database?
```
22
```
1. Once logged in you should have acces to the DB on the bottom of the page. We're going to use SQLMap and BurpSuite to get all the information.
2. On the browser, enable FoxyProxy to route the traffic through Burp
3. Open Burpsuite and make sure Intercept is ON
4. On the browser, submit a request to the database. It can be anything.
5. Burpsuite should catch the request. Right click it and send it to Repeater.
6. You should now find the GET request on the repeater tab. Right click it and save it.
7. Use SQLMap to find the information on the DB from the Burpsuite scan.
```
sqlmap -r ~/Desktop/scan --dbms sqlite --dump-all --tamper=space2comment
```
We know from the dossier that Santa uses __sqlite__ as the dbms. We also use the `--dump-all` tag to dump all the information about the DB. The final tag is to bypass the Web Application Firewall.
8. The result of the command should give the answers to the rest of the questions

### 4. What did Paul ask for?
```
Github Ownership
```

### 5. What is the flag?

Yes

### 6. What is admin's password?

Yes
