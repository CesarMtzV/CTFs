- Authentication
- Default Credentials
- Dictionary Attack Using Burpsuite

### 1. What is the flag?

When we enter the IP of the machine into the browser, we get a login form to Santa Sleigh Tracker. We are going to use Burpsuite to intercept our traffic. If you're using the AttackBox, there should be an extension already installed to proxy your requests through burp. Just activate it and open Burpsuite.\

1. On Burpsuite, create a new temporary project and go to the Proxy Tab, make sure Intercept is On.
2. On the website, login with a random user and a random password. If you're using the proxy, the website should get "stuck" in loading after clicking submit. That's because Burpsuite is stopping the traffic.
3. On Burpsuite, click on the __Forward__ button until you get a POST request with the username and password you entered.
4. Once you have the POST request, righ click it and send it to Intruder.
5. On the Intruder Tab, select __Cluster bomb__ as the Attack Type.
6. On the Intruder Tab, go to the payloads tab. We are going to have 2 payload sets, 1 is for the usernames and 2 is for the passwords.
    - While on Payload set 1, add the usernames that are provided to us in the dossier
    - Do the same thing with the passwords, but change the Payload set to 2.
7. Once the payload is set, click on the Start Attack button.
8. When the attack finishes you should see one of the results with a Length smaller than all the other. That's because they're the right credentials, you can confirm by inspecting the response and looking at the returned html.
9. Turn off the extension for the browser and login to the website using the correct credentials. There you should find the flag.
