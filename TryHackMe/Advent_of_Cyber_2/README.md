# Advent of Cyber - Writeup

> César Martínez | RedAiden

This is a writeup for all 24 days of the Advent of Cyber 2 Event @ TryHackMe.

__Notes:__
- Some rooms where done using a Kali Linux VM while others were done using the THM AttackBox
- I included the majority of the answers for all the questions, except for the flags.
    - This with the purpose of clearing any confusion about the answer format
