# [Day 4] Web Exploitation - Santa's watching

## Topics:

- Fuzzing
- gobuster
- wfuzz

### 1. Given the URL "http://shibes.xyz/api.php", what would the entire wfuzz command look like to query the "breed" parameter using the wordlist "big.txt" (assume that "big.txt" is in your current directory)
```
wfuzz -c -z file,big.txt http://shibes.xyz/api.php?breed=FUZZ
```

### 2. Use GoBuster (against the target you deployed -- not the shibes.xyz domain) to find the API directory. What file is there?
```
site-login.php
```

The gobuster command should look something like this:
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.20.242/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```
In this case we're using the `common.txt` wordlist. After a few seconds we find a list of available directories, one of them being `/api`. When we acces the website with this specific directory, we find our target file.

### 3. Fuzz the date parameter on the file you found in the API directory. What is the flag displayed in the correct post?

1. Use wfuzz to find the correct paramter.
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/opt/AoC-2020/Day-4/wordlist -d "date=FUZZ" -u http://10.10.20.242/api/site-log.php?date=FUZZ
```
2. Once wfuzz finishes, we should see one of the results with a different number of Chars. Copy the payload of that result and use it as the date parameter in the URL of the site. The URL should look like this: `http://10.10.X.X/api/site-log.php?date=20201125`. inside of this url is the flag.
