## Description
> Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

## Solution
We can use a simple python function to find this answer rather than doing it manually.

```python
>>> bin(42)

'0b101010'
```
This function is a built-in pyhton function that converts decimal values into binary.
